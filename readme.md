This is the server code for 'WheresApp', my social media application. The backend was written in Express/Node.js and accepts requests from the React frontend.

Request capabilities include authentication and posting to the database. Users can login and create/edit/delete posts. Profile images and post images get uploaded and hosted to Cloudinary.
